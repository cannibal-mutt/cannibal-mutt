                          I have Audhd and a few other things I'm not willing to share fully.
                      I may come off as standoffish, as I'm quiet unless spoken to first normally.
                                            I use tone tags occasinally-

            I block and hide freely! Don't get upset, I have my reasons. Though, I do try to be patient with people.
                Please don't cover me, or copy my skins! I work hard on them and would like to see them!!‚ö†Ô∏é
